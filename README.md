### DATA WRANGLING
* **Frankfurt Stock Exchange:** An Application Programming Interface (API) based mini-project using financial market data.
      https://github.com/martell-n-tardy/Frankfurt-Stock-Exchange


### MACHINE LEARNING
* **Logistic Regression:** A case study applying the supervised learning method of logistic regression to classify the binary gender of a sample correctly.
      https://github.com/martell-n-tardy/Logistic-Regression-Advanced-Case-Study

* **Decision Trees:** A case study applying the supervised learning method of decision trees to build four different decision tree models — two using entropy and two using gini impurity — to ascertain whether a potentially business-transforming deal with a mysterious coffee farm in China will take your business to the next level. 
      https://github.com/martell-n-tardy/Decision-Trees-Case-Study

* **Random Forest:** A case study applying the supervised learning method of random forest and logistic regression to understand the scope of the Coronavirus using data from December and January of 2020. 
      https://github.com/martell-n-tardy/Random-Forest-Case-Study
      
* **Gradient Boosting:** A case study applying the supervised learning method of gradient boosting to improve predictions based on information from the residuals of a regression problem then of a classification problem using the Titanic dataset.
      https://github.com/martell-n-tardy/Gradient-Boosting-Case-Study

* **Euclidean and Manhattan Distance:** A case study applying the unsupervised learning method of Euclidean and Manhattan distance metrics and visualizing their distances on the same dataset. 
      https://github.com/martell-n-tardy/Euclidean-and-Manhattan-Distance-Case-Study

* **Cosine Similarity:** A case study applying the unsupervised learning method of cosine similarity to calculate a numeric dataset and explore the utility of this method for record matching and NLP projects.
      https://github.com/martell-n-tardy/Cosine-Similarity-Case-Study

* **Customer Segmentation:** A case study applying the unsupervised learning method of the K-Means clustering algorithm to find the value for K using the Elbow method, the Silhouette method, and the Gap statistic, and visualize the clusters with Principal Components Analysis (PCA). Real data containing information on marketing newsletters and email campaigns, as well as transaction-level data from customers was used.
