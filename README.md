* **Euclidean and Manhattan Distance:** A case study applying the unsupervised learning method of Euclidean and Manhattan distance metrics and visualizing their distances on the same dataset. 
      https://github.com/martell-n-tardy/Euclidean-and-Manhattan-Distance-Case-Study

* **Cosine Similarity:** A case study applying the unsupervised learning method of cosine similarity to calculate a numeric dataset and explore the utility of this method for record matching and NLP projects.
      https://github.com/martell-n-tardy/Cosine-Similarity-Case-Study

* **Customer Segmentation:** A case study applying the unsupervised learning method of the K-Means clustering algorithm to find the value for K using the Elbow method, the Silhouette method, and the Gap statistic, and visualize the clusters with Principal Components Analysis (PCA). Real data containing information on marketing newsletters and email campaigns, as well as transaction-level data from customers was used.

* **Bayesian Optimization:** A case study applying the Bayesian methods of probabilities to select the optimal hyperparameters for a Light GBM model.
      https://github.com/martell-n-tardy/Bayesian-Parameter-Optimization


### TIME SERIES ANALYSIS
* **Cowboy Cigarettes:** A case study applying time series methods to the US's longest-running cigarette manufacturer, Cowboy Cigarettes(TM, est. 1890) 1949-1960 data to predict whether their cigarette sales actually increased, decreased, or stayed the same in the early 60s.

## BIG DATA (Spark and Pyspark)
* **Spark: Databricks Edition:** A mini-project applying PySpark DataFrames and MLib to construct classification models. I published the mini-project on Databricks and therefore it has been made public. Please note, the link for this mini-project will take you to an external site outside of the Github platform.
